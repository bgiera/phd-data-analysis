# phd-data-analysis
These scripts contain a variety of data analysis functions used throughout my PhD. They can be used to generate LAMMPS scripts, calculate statistical thermodynamics quantities on molecular dynamics trajectories, create publication quality figures, etc. The fortran code requires the f2py package and enables rapid calculation of the chemical and electrostatic potential from simulations described here:
